Middleware in web development is like a set of tools or functions that help manage and process incoming requests and outgoing responses in an application. We use middleware to add extra features like authentication, logging, or error handling to our application without cluttering up our main code. Without middleware, our application might lack important functionalities, become harder to manage, and potentially be less secure.
